# Roman-Numerals
I prepared a javascript code that returns the number entered by the user as a roman numeral.
There is only one issue, I asked the user to enter up to 3888 thousand as the maximum number, I added
it because it is the longest number in terms of the number of characters that can be written with roman numerals.
The program only works on the console screen.
